# Perfect-Theme
This is the resulting Cinnamon theme from merging certain components that I like of the Cinnamon themes Linux Mint, Tyr Himmin, and Windows 10 Light in the cinnamon.css files. This has been created by editing the Tyr Himmin cinnamon.css. I am still making edits to add even more touches to the theme, but the main difficulty is handling images in CSS.
